Understanding the Core Requirements:
Platform: HTML5, deployable on standard web browsers and embeddable within Zalo Mini App (mobile application).

Goal: Engage users, potentially collect basic user info (Name, Phone, Age - handle privacy carefully!), encourage sharing, and drive brand association ("3 Tá»‘t" - 3 Goods).

Core Gameplay Loop (Specific to each game).
