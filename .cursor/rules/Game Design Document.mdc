*   **1. Overview:** A fast-paced catching game where players collect falling VinaSoy beans while avoiding rotten ones, competing for high scores and accumulating rewards.
*   **2. Core Gameplay:**
    *   **Objective:** Catch as many 'Good Soybeans' as possible within 60 seconds.
    *   **Controls:** Swipe left/right or use arrow keys (desktop) to move the collection basket horizontally.
    *   **Game Elements:**
        *   *Basket:* Player-controlled element. 5 Baskets represent lives.
        *   *Good Soybeans:* Fall randomly from the top. Award points (+1 or more). May have different visual types representing "3 Tốt" benefits (e.g., "Tình duyên tốt," "Sức khỏe tốt").
            *   *Green Beans:* Represent "sức khỏe" (health). Catching them displays health-related messages.
            *   *Yellow Beans:* Represent "tài lộc" (wealth). Catching them displays wealth-related messages.
            *   *Purple Beans:* Represent "tình duyên" (romance). Catching them displays romance-related messages.
            *   *Streak System:* Catching beans of the same color consecutively activates a streak (similar to Audition game).
                *   Congratulatory messages escalate with each bean in the streak while maintaining the same theme.
                *   Streaks multiply the points rewarded for each bean caught.
                *   The longer the streak, the higher the point multiplier.
            *   *Golden Soya Bean:* A special larger yellow bean that can substitute for any regular bean to continue a streak.
                *   Acts as a wildcard to maintain streak combos.
                *   Provides higher base points than regular beans.
        *   *Bad Soybeans:* Fall randomly. Catching one results in losing a basket (-1 life). Visual distinction (e.g., moldy, dark color).
        *   *Timer:* Counts down from 60 seconds.
        *   *Score Display:* Shows current points.
        *   *Lives Display:* Shows remaining baskets (e.g., 5 icons).
    *   **Game End Conditions:**
        *   Timer reaches 0.
        *   Player loses all 5 baskets.
        *   Player manually quits (less common).
